            <h1>What the Punk?!</h1>
            <p>Street style. Anti-establishment. Edgy outfits. Alternative. All of these words are used to describe people who rebel and embrace punk fashion. </p>
            <p>Punk fashion includes clothing, hair, makeup, and jewelry. The style can change wildly from person to person, whether they are a fashion designer, band member, or your average punk.</p>
            <p>But where did the punk movement begin, and what does it really include? </p>
            <h2>Counterculture Culture</h2>
            <p>Punk fashion goes against the “norm.” The punk style first emerged in the streets of London during the mid-1970s and was highly influenced by punk rock, an aggressive style of rock music that emphasized self-expression and self-assertion. People wanted to be heard, and they were not afraid of looking or sounding gritty when doing it. </p>
            <p>Expressing one's unique identity and not conforming to rules formed the backbone of the punk movement; punk fashion was a protest. Punks were making statements about money, war, and clothing standards that shocked and offended 1970s society. </p>

        <h1>THE BIRTH OF PUNK</h1>
        <p>In the 1970s, people in Britain were experiencing mass unemployment. There were also conversations about women's rights, equality for LGBTQIA+ community, environmental crises, and conflicts like the Vietnam war around the world. As a result, punks started to dressin deliberately torn clothes, rags, and second-hand oufits. These people wanted to boldly show that something was wrong with society and that big changes had to happen. </p>

          <h2>VIVIENNE WESTWOOD</h2>
          <p>Many fashion designers started making messy, edgy clothes for the punk movement. The most famous fashion pioneer from the 1970s is Vivienne Westwood, the “mother of punk.”</p>
          <p>Vivienne Westwood worked with Malcolm McLaren to make punk more mainstream. She created  fashionable outfits with shocking graphics, rips, and belts.</p>
